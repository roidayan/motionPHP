motionPHP is a web based front end for the motion detection software Motion (http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome).

Features:

- See the latest captured events
- See all frames for an event
- View the events recorded by different cameras
- Watch the recorded video (swf, mpeg etc) of an event

This is my first PHP project and is very much a work in progress. Documentation is coming soon.
