motionPHP is a web based front end for the motion detection software Motion (http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome).

Features:

- See the latest captured events
- See all frames for an event
- View the events recorded by different cameras
- Watch the recorded video (swf, mpeg etc) of an event

This is my first PHP project and is very much a work in progress. Documentation is coming soon.


Documentation (this is just the jist, full documentation will be written soon): 
Motion must be compiled with mysql for motionPHP to work, and must be compiled with ffmpeg if you want videos to work.

Certain options in Motion's config file have to set in order to be compatible with motionPHP [needs completing]

Create the following table in database "motion" (or whatever table is defined in includes/conf.php)

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `security` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `camera` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `event_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `filename` char(80) NOT NULL,
  `frame` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `file_type` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `time_stamp` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `event_time_stamp` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=5734 ;

Next, create a user, or assign an existing user to the database with full privileges. Enter the user details in includes/conf.php.
